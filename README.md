A minimalist portfolio website showcasing my work.

## Development

This repository hosts a static site served through GitHub Pages. Edit `index.html` and open it in your browser to preview changes.

## Analytics Dashboard

Client-side visit and click analytics are captured with `analytics.js` and can be reviewed on the password-protected admin panel at [`/admin.html`](admin.html). Use the password `ra1ph_` to unlock the dashboard. All analytics data is stored in the visitor's browser via `localStorage`, so clearing the dashboard only affects the current device.

## Deployment

Push to the `main` branch and GitHub Pages will rebuild the site automatically.
